While this statement reflected the Notice’s tentative conclusion concerning Internet traffic exchange, it in no way detracts from the fact that the Notice also sought comment on “whether we should change our conclusion,” whether to adopt proposals to “expand the scope of the open Internet rules to cover issues related to traffic exchange,” and how to “ensure that a broadband provider would not be able to evade our open Internet rules by engaging in traffic exchange practices that would be outside the scope of the rules as proposed.”  Id. at 5582, para. 59."},{"value":483,"text":"See infra Section IV."},{"value":484,"text":"See infra para.

A Review of the Recent Case Law at 23 (filed Oct. 31, 2014) (Phoenix Center Oct. 31, 2014 Ex Parte Letter) (concluding that the Verizon court took the view that “706(a) is independent from 706(b), because the court seemed to say that the defined trigger of 706(b) is irrelevant to the Commission’s on-going (and independent) effort to promote broadband deployment under 706(a) under foreseeable market conditions”).  Contrary to one of the dissenting statements, (see Pai Dissent at 56), Commission actions adopted pursuant to a negative section 706(b) determination would not simply be swept away by a future positive section 706(b) finding.  The Commission takes such measures precisely to achieve section 706(b)’s goal of accelerating deployment.  That they may succeed in achieving that goal so as to contribute to a positive section 706(b) finding does not subsequently render them unnecessary or unauthorized without any further Commission process.  Throwing away such measures because they are working would be like “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”  Shelby v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2650 (2013) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  Even if that were not the case, independent section 706(a) authority would remain.  We mention, however, two legal requirements that appear relevant.  First, section 408 of the Act mandates that “all” FCC orders (other than orders for the payment of money) “shall continue in force for the period of time specified in the order or until the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction issues a superseding order.”  47 U.S.C. § 408.  Second, the Commission has a “continuing obligation to practice reasoned decisionmaking” that includes revisiting prior decisions to the extent warranted.  Aeronautical Radio v.

First, as noted above, it rejected that view in favor of the position of other commenters that “the network should not be defined in a static way,” an interpretation it found more consistent with the determination by Congress not to employ the term “public switched telephone network.”  Second, it stated that any switched common carrier service that is interconnected with the traditional local or interexchange switched network would be defined “as part of” the public switched network “for purposes of our definition,” id. at 1436-37.  Even as early as 1994, the comments on which the Commission relied for its definition, id. at 1437, para. 60, made this very point.  Comments of Nextel Communications, Inc. at 11 (“In the not-too-distant future, telephony will consist of ‘networks of networks’ linking together landline, fiber, wireless, microwave and satellite systems,” so that the definition should include “any services – whether landline or wireless – offered on a co-carrier basis to enhance or extend the reach and functionalities of traditional local exchange or interexchange facilities”); Comments of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell at 5 (current definition is “a vestige of telecommunications history” and “needs to be revised,” given “revolution” in the industry in which “new providers and new services appear almost weekly” that are interconnected with the traditional PSN and “are substitutes for components of the PSN”).  Comments of other wireless providers, with whom the Commission agreed about avoiding “a static way” of defining the network, id. at 1436, para. 59, made the same point.  See, e.g., Comments of Bell Atlantic Cos. at 6, 9 & n.9 (citing Commission’s “poor experience” in trying to apply definitions, arguing that “[b]road definitions are essential,” emphasizing that the Commission “cannot anticipate all such [new PCS] technologies . . . interfacing with the network,” and urging it to “discard the use of the anachronistic term ‘public switched telephone network’ (‘PSTN’)”); Comments of NYNEX Corp. at 8-9 (definition should not include “only the traditional LEC-provided public switched telephone network (‘PSTN’),” so as to “reflect today’s competitive environment for wireless services” and the “quickly and constantly evolving concept” of the network, in which cable, cellular, and PCS systems and other services could, “for millions of people, make access to the ‘old PSTN’ unnecessary”)."},{"value":1146,"text":"See AT&T Feb. 2, 2015 Ex Parte Letter at 2; see also CTIA Dec. 22, 2014 Ex Parte Letter, Attach. at 8."},{"value":1147,"text":"We are not persuaded by AT&T’s arguments that rely, not on the foregoing language or purpose of the 1993 statute at issue, but on subsequent statutes enacted for different purposes in 1996 and 2012.  See, e.g., Gutierrez v.

Quite apart from canons of statutory construction, this argument disregards the signal difference in Section 332(d), which delegates the question of the scope of its terms to the Commission in light of its experience and market developments over time.  We note, however, that AT&T’s reliance on the “policy” of the 1996 Act reflected in Section 230 is similar to one that Verizon made but that was not found by the Verizon court to be a bar to its conclusion that “section 706 grants the Commission authority to promote broadband deployment by regulating how broadband providers treat edge providers.”  Verizon, 740 F.3d at 649; see Verizon Br.

We note that if a mobile service is not interconnected to the public switched network (as updated herein) and otherwise meets the definition of “commercial mobile data service” in section 20.3 of the Commission’s rules, it will continue to be subject to the data roaming rules.

However, given that mobile broadband was not classified as a Title I information service until 2007, it is not clear the extent to which increases in investment before then can be attributed to a non-CMRS regulatory environment.  Furthermore, voice service has continued to account for a significant portion of revenues.

As one example, the Commission has granted some forbearance from section 310(d) for certain wireless licensees that meet the definition of “telecommunications carrier,” see generally Federal Communications Bar Association's Petition for Forbearance from Section 310(d) of the Communications Act, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 13 FCC Rcd 6293 (1998) (FCBA Forbearance Order), but section 310(d) is not itself framed in terms of “common carriers” or “telecommunications carriers” or providers of “CMRS” or the like, nor is it framed in terms of “common carrier services,” “telecommunications services,” “CMRS services” or the like.  To the extent that such forbearance thus goes beyond the forbearance for wireless providers granted in this Order, this Order does not narrow or otherwise modify that pre-existing grant of forbearance.

See generally 2011 Pole Attachment Order.  To the extent that commenters express concern about possible rate changes following our reclassification of broadband Internet access under that statutory and regulatory framework, see ACA Jan. 20, 2015 Ex Parte Letter at 2-3; NCTA Dec. 23, 2014 Ex Parte Letter at 21 n.107, we are not persuaded on this record that forbearance would be a viable way to address them, for the reasons discussed below.

Consistent with our general approach to forbearance here, which seeks to address new requirements that could be triggered by our classification of broadband Internet access service, we do not forbear with respect to provisions to the extent that they already applied prior to this Order.  For example, section 271(c) establishes substantive standards that a BOC was required to meet in order to obtain authorization to provide interLATA services in an in-region state, and which it and must continue to meet in order to retain that authorization.  47 U.S.C. § 271(c); see 47 U.S.C. § 271(d)(6) (authorizing various Commission actions in the event the Commission determines that a BOC has ceased to meet the conditions for authorization to provide in-region, interLATA services).

In addition, while the BOC-specific provisions of section 276 theoretically could be newly implicated insofar as the reclassification of broadband Internet access service might result in some entities newly being treated as a BOC, the bulk of section 276 appears independent of the classification of broadband Internet access service and we thus do not forbear as to those provisions."},{"value":1594,"text":"See supra Sections V.C.2.a, V.C.2.c., V.C.3."},{"value":1595,"text":"See supra Section V.C.2.e."},{"value":1596,"text":"See supra paras.

When Congress adopted section 230 as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, of course it did not anticipate the precise definition the FCC would adopt almost 20 years later—but it could and did broadly define “interactive computer service” to envelop “any” information service provider, and “specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet.”  Communications Act § 230(f)(2) (emphasis added).

And that’s why even today the tariffs of the National Exchange Carrier Association describe Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) as a local point-to-point service.

That change?  Deleting the word “all” from the definition of interconnected service!  Order at Appendix A.  There are many words one could use to describe this amendment.  “Conforming” (or “minor”) is not one of them.  Under this change, every user of Network A (say, the public switched telephone network) could lack the capability to communicate with any user of Network B (say, the Internet) and vice-versa, but, because of the FCC’s definitional change, Network A and Network B would now be a single, interconnected network.  That is plainly at odds with the entire structure of section 332 and any reasonable understanding of the concept of an interconnected network and interconnected services.Indeed, the FCC never proposed such a change, has no record on which to do so, and nowhere explains how the change can be squared with the text, purpose, or history of section 332, including the Commission’s own view that the purpose of the interconnected services definition is to ensure that those services are “broadly available.”  See Order at para. 402.  Although the Order tries to bolster its approach by contending that the definition of “interconnected service” and the CMRS Second Report and Order recognize that a service can be interconnected even if access is limited in some ways, Order at para. 402 & note 1172, this effort fails because the FCC there was focusing on phenomena such as service providers intentionally limiting users’ access to the public switched network to certain hours each day, for the sole purpose of avoiding classification as a commercial mobile service.  See, e.g., CMRS Second Report and Order, 9 FCC Rcd at 1435, para. 55.

So a service is a private mobile service if it isn’t interconnected with the public switched network—even if it’s provided for a fee and made available to a substantial portion of the public (or even every single American).  Any other reading of the statute would render one part of the statutory test surplusage.  Indeed, the Commission has made this very point.  See CMRS Second Report and Order, 9 FCC Rcd at 1450–51, paras. 88–93 (concluding that most specialized mobile radio services meet the first two parts of the test so that the classification of any particular specialized mobile radio service thus “turns on whether they do, in fact, provide interconnected service as defined by the statute”).
